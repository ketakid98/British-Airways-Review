# British Airways Review Dashboard

## Overview
The British Airways Review Dashboard is a Tableau-based data visualization tool that analyzes customer satisfaction across various segments and demographics. This dashboard helps stakeholders understand customer experiences by country, class, and specific satisfaction metrics such as food quality and value for money.

## Data Sources
The dashboard leverages the following datasets:
1. **BA Reviews Dataset**: Contains customer satisfaction ratings by country and class type, segmented by customer type (e.g., family, couples, business).
2. **Countries Dataset**: A complementary file that assists with mapping and geographic analysis.

## Metrics and Visualizations

### Key Metrics
- **Overall Customer Satisfaction**: Analyzes customer satisfaction levels across various countries.
- **Class-Specific Satisfaction**: Includes satisfaction ratings for Economy and Business class passengers.
- **Demographic-Based Satisfaction**: Segments satisfaction scores by family, couples, and business traveler groups.
- **Food Satisfaction**: Measures satisfaction with onboard food quality, broken down by class.
- **Value for Money**: Evaluates the perceived value received relative to ticket cost.

### Visualizations
- **Interactive Map**: Displays an interactive, color-coded map showing customer satisfaction ratios for each country, allowing users to explore satisfaction ratings geographically.
- **Class and Demographic Breakdowns**: Users can filter satisfaction ratings by class type (e.g., Economy or Business) and customer type (e.g., family, couples).
- **Metric-Specific Filters**: Filters allow users to view satisfaction based on specific aspects like food and overall value, helping stakeholders pinpoint areas for improvement.

## Using the Dashboard
1. **Navigating**: Use the interactive map to view satisfaction ratings by country.
2. **Filtering**: Apply filters to refine results by class, customer type, and specific satisfaction metrics.
3. **Interactivity**: Hover over map regions to see detailed information for each country.

## Project Goals
The primary objective of this dashboard is to help British Airways gain insights into customer satisfaction across different regions, demographic groups, and service classes, which can inform service improvements and targeted customer engagement.

## Technical Requirements
- **Software**: Tableau Desktop (for modifications) or Tableau Reader (for view-only access).
- **Data Refresh**: To update the dashboard with new data, replace the existing data source in Tableau with the latest CSV files.
